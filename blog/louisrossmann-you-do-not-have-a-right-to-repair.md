### Right To Repair
I have been a subscriber to Louis Rossmann’s YouTube channel for well over a year. I have watched many of his Right To Repair videos. I do not believe in Right To Repair, I wanted to share my opinion and see if anyone in this sub agrees with my views. Moreover, I think Louis leveraging the government to achieve his goals is counter-productive for consumers.

### Free-market Economics 101
Fundamentally, you, the consumer, decide who you do business with. If you decide to purchase a product, that does not entitle you to access to schematics, diagnostic repair tools or any other intellectual property. If you do not like the repair practices of a company, you can express this by not purchasing their products.

A business only exists because it’s customers voluntarily give them money in exchange for a product or service. If this stops the business will cease to exist. Shareholders want to maximise profits and have a long-term financial interest in a business. If a business practice is causing customers not to buy a product, management will be financially incentivised to change this practice.

It seems misguided to petition the government so corrupt and inept officials will enact abstract Right To Repair legislation. Organising boycotts of businesses engaging in unfair repair practices would be far more effective.

### John Deere
A focal point of the right to repair movement has been John Deere agricultural machinery. The company has made it very difficult for farmers to repair their own vehicles costing farmers great expense to get their vehicles operational.

If nobody bought any John Deer farm equipment for a whole quarter, their stock price would plummet, the board would pick a new CEO and he’d be handing out repair manuals to anyone who asked.

### Conclusion
I have just described a completely voluntary method for making products more repairable that does not require fighting well-funded lobbyists or asking for the Government’s help. Government regulation only increases barrier to entry which limits competition, which is bad for consumers.

The government cannot solve our problems, only the free-market can.
