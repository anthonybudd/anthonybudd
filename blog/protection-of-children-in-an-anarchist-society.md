I am very attracted to the ideas of free-market Anarchy but I feel that all of the various implementations of Anarchist society do not satisfy the wider public’s desire for the protection of children.

Children seem to present a grey zone with regard to Anarchist ideas of free-will and voluntary interaction. A hardline interpretation of the Non-Agression Principal would suggest that a loving parent trying to feed a crying baby is assault or a curfew constitutes false imprisonment. Of course these scenarios may be in the best interest of the child but this raises the question, what rights does a child have and what responsibilities does a parent have for the well being of the child? Not to mention, what is a child and who decides when a child becomes an adult? How can these rights be defined without a legislative body?

While the universal freedom of Anarchy promises unprecedented possibilities for human civilization, nobody wants to live in a society where sexual abuse of children goes unpunished or neglectful parenting is not addressed.

In my favorite book, Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy he says the following;

> Another point to consider is the enhanced role of adoption in a free society. Much as it shocks modern sensibilities, there would be a fully functioning “baby market,” in which parental privileges were sold to the highest bidder. Although seemingly crass, such a market would surely reduce child abuse. After all, abusive or negligent parents are probably the ones most likely to offer their children for adoption, when loving couples are allowed to pay them handsomely for it

This is my one issue with the book, I do not like this at all because nothing would stop a pedophile buying the parental rights of a child with the express intent of abusing the child. This is clearly not a plausible strategy if we want to convince normies to stop voting and join the Anarchist cause.

One possible solution I have considered but am not satisfied with is, schools and apartment complexes could require all children to have a “protection policy” to enter the property. This policy would mandate regular doctors visits and would have mechanisms for removal of a child if abuse was discovered. Another solution I don’t particularly like but I am sympathetic to is simply vigilanteism.

Fundamentally my question is, in an Anarchist society what voluntary systems could be implemented that would protect a child from sexual or physical abuse?
