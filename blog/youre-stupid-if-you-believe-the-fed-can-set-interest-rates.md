# You're Stupid If You Think The Fed Can Set Interest Rates.

Recently it has occurred to me that almost all economic literature is incorrect. As someone who dropped out of the education system at 16 and taught myself economics, it has become increasingly clear to me that the theories taught by contemporary economics professors, studied by their students, and implemented by government officials are completely nonsensical. A shining example of this is The Fed and interest rates. 

We’ve all seen the headlines “The Fed is increasing/decreasing interest rates”. These interest rate changes are always major financial events that impact the entire US economy from the stock market to mortgages to consumer products. But upon deeper evaluation it’s obvious to anyone with a triple-digit IQ that this statement is completely incongruent with basic economic principles.

### Objective Laws of Economics

The First Law of Thermodynamics, states that energy can not be created or destroyed, but can only be transformed from one form to another. Just as there are inviolable laws of physics there are also objective laws of economics that cannot be broken. 

Regardless of what you were taught at your fancy university, no human can mess with the objective laws of economics just as no human can play fast and loose with the laws of physics.

### Interest Rates and Opportunity Costs

Interest rates is the cost of moving money through time. When a debtor borrows money he is moving money from the future to the present. Conversely when a saver deposits money into a savings account he is forgoing his money in the present with the objective of retrieving it in the future. 

Opportunity cost is, the loss of potential gain from other mutually exclusive alternative uses of a finite resource when one alternative is chosen. In essence, opportunity cost is the benefits you miss out on when choosing one option over another. For example, since time is a finite resource, when choosing to play a video game over studying for an exam, the opportunity cost is the potential higher grade you could have achieved had you chosen to study, conversely had you studied you would have missed-out on the enjoyment of playing the video game. 

Money is a finite resource, because of this depositing money into a savings account is not "free", the saver is incurring the cost of forgoing the potential benefits associated with the other competing uses for that money, like going on a vacation for the benefit of personal enjoyment or investing in stocks for the benefit of a potential higher return. 

Because money is a finite resource, there will always be a cost for moving money through time.

### 0% Interest Rates

Interest rates are set by the market based on the supply of capital a financial institution has to issue to borrowers as loans and the demand for that capital. A low interest rate suggests that there is an abundance of savings a bank can issue as loans, conversely a high interest rate indicates scarcity of savings. 

In both 2008 and in 2020 The Fed set a 0% interest rate. This is absolutely absurd yet academia and financial professionals didn’t bat an eye. A 0% interest rate means that there is no cost for moving money throughout time, which violates fundamental economic principals. 

### Conclusion

It’s high-time we reevaluate what constitutes genuine economic theory and bullshit wishful-thinking. Contrary to popular belief the Government does not have our best interests at heart and like it or not an economy is far to complex for any human to "correct" markets without unintended unpredictable side-effects. The 2008 housing bubble being the most relevant example of this.

In free-market economics prices are set by the market. No government official can arbitrarily dictate the cost of moving money through time. If you believe otherwise, see the title of this post.
