# You're Stupid If You Believe The Fed Can Set Interest Rates.

Recently it has occurred to me that almost all economic literature is incorrect. As someone who dropped out of the education system at 16 and taught myself economics, it has become increasingly clear to me that almost all economics professors, their graduates, the financial press and financial professionals are completely stupid. A shining example of this is The Fed and interest rates. 

We’ve all seen the headlines “The Fed is increasing/decreasing interest rates”. These interest rate changes are always major financial events that impact the entire US economy from the stock market to mortgages to consumer products. But upon deeper evaluation it’s obvious to anyone with a triple-digit IQ that this statement is completely incongruent with basic economic principles.

Just as there are inviolable laws of physics there are also objective laws of economics that cannot be broken. One of these is the law of supply and demand, which defines the price of any asset based on the supply of the asset and its market demand. For example, at any point in time there is a stock of rice ready to be sold on the market. Demand is harder to objectively define but generally speaking we can say that the higher the price, less of that product will be purchased, inversely, the lower the price the more of that product will be purchased. To illustrate this, consider the price of rice were to climb to \$1000 per kilogram, few people will be able to purchase rice and demand will be reduced. If the price of rice were to fall to \$0.01 per kilogram many more people will be able to afford it and more rice will be purchased. This is because as prices decrease the product will become less costly to buyers relative to other substitute products, their stock of money and competing uses for that money.

Interest rates are defined by the supply of capital a financial institution has to issue to borrowers as loans. Regardless of what you were taught at your fancy college, no human can mess with the objective laws of economics just as no human can play fast and loose with the laws of physics. Anyone suggesting otherwise should **NOT** be teaching economics. Likewise any professor who claims that an object with mass can travel faster than the speed of light should **NOT** be teaching physics.

In both 2008 and in 2020 The Fed had a 0% interest rate. This is absolutely absurd yet academia and the financial elite didn’t bat an eye. A 0% interest rate means that there is no cost for moving money throughout time. A 0% interest rate suggests that a tonne of steel today is equally as valuable as a tonne of steel in 100 years time. The stupidity of this notion requires no further discussion.

All prices, and by extension interest rates (the price of moving money back or forward in time) contain vital economic data. A low interest rate suggests that there is an abundance of savings a bank can issue as loans, conversely a high interest rate indicates scarcity of savings. By make-believing in an arbitrary interest rate, we are obfuscating a vital metric for financial decision making. 

However this is far more insidious than meets the eye. The university educated financial professionals can wax poetic about the superiority of dynamic "free"-market based economic systems compared to the sluggish soviet planned economies of the 20th century. Why then do they not seem to mind when a human screws with our economy today? Especially when its having such disastrous consequences. It's abundantly obvious that academia and the financial elite are working hand-in-hand with the Government to first mislead under-graduates and then destroy the working persons economic future by pulling the rug from beneath them via Fed policy.

Academia and the financial elite have perpetuated these lies to financially oppress the average working person and misappropriate their wealth through economic chicanery. It’s high-time we reevaluate what constitutes true economic theory and bullshit pseudo-science. Contrary to popular belief the Government does not have our best interests at heart and no human has the ability to "correct" markets without catastrophic unintended and unpredictable side-effects. The 2008 housing bubble being the most fitting example of this. To conclude, a random man in a far away office (aka Jerome Powell) cannot arbitrarily dictate the price of an asset at a whim. If you believe otherwise, see the title of this post.
