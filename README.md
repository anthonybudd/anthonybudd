### [S4](https://github.com/anthonybudd/s4)


![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/anthonybudd/s4?style=social)
S4 is 100% compatible AWS S3 storage, accessed through Tor and distributed using IPFS. Tor acts as a DNS and [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) acts as a CDN and will make your data permanently accessible and is almost impossible to take offline once it has been published. A [sidecar docker container](https://github.com/anthonybudd/s4-client)  is provided to seamlessly proxy requests from your existing S3 code over Tor to S4.

    ];

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-PHP-success?style=flat) ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/anthonybudd/wp_route?style=social)


WP_Route is a simple way to create custom routes in WordPress for listening for webhooks, oAuth callbacks and basic routing. WP_Route is a single class solution that supports route parameters and redirects and does not require any set-up.
```PHP
WP_Route::get('flights',                        'listFlights');
WP_Route::post('flights/{flight}',              'singleFlight');
WP_Route::put('flights/{flight}/book/{date}',   'bookFlight');
WP_Route::delete('flights/{flight}/delete',     'deleteFlight');

WP_Route::any('flights/{flight}',               array('Class', 'staticMethod'));
WP_Route::patch('flights/{flight}',             array($object, 'method'));
WP_Route::match(['get', 'post'],                'flights/{flight}/confirm', 'confirmFlight');
WP_Route::redirect('/from/here',                 '/to/here', 301);
```

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-PHP-success?style=flat) ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/anthonybudd/wp_mail?style=social)


WP_Mail is the simplest and most powerful dynamic email class available for WordPress. The class provides simple methods for attaching files, custom headers and lots of helper functions. The class only sends emails using the WordPress function wp_mail(), this means that all of your existing SMTP settings will continue to work with no additional config or set-up required.
```PHP
$email = WP_Mail::init()
    ->to('john.doe@gmail.com')
    ->subject('WP_Mail is great!')
    ->template(get_template_directory() .'/emails/example.php', [
        'name'     => 'Anthony Budd',
        'location' => 'London',
        'skills'   => [
           'PHP',
           'AWS',
        ] 
    ])
    ->send();
```
